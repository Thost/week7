<b>What did you think?</b>
<p>I first tried the Odessey.js storymap application because it seemed appropriate for the Tour de France story map that I was envisioning.
Marker points were easy to create but I had trouble getting polylines between the stages to display properly (or at all).</p>
<p>So I decided to try the knightlab storymap and stick with start/end point markers. It worked GREAT!
I was able to quickly put together slides with city locations (with the handy google maps search box embeded) as well as text and photos. It was exetremely user-friendly.
There are two tabs for 'preview' and 'edit' of the storymap which allowed quick checks to make sure the map was displaying as intended. All of the text and images were from <a href='http://www.letour.com/le-tour/2016/us/'>http://www.letour.com/le-tour/2016/us/</a>
<p>To improve, I would try to create polylines for each stage route, this would take more than point data and probably one of the more sophisticated storymap program. </p>
<p> Hope you enjoyed zooming around France!</p>
